As a Java developer who’s worked on data-intensive projects like the Mosaic Smart Data realtime-api, Co-op’s
competitor pricing reports, and ESG Global’s smart metering orchestration layer, I’ve spent years navigating complex
codebases and tight deadlines. But the real challenge isn’t just writing clean code, it’s staying focused in a world of
constant digital noise. emails, notifications, and social media can derail even the most disciplined coder. That’s where
digital minimalism comes in:

Reflecting on my contracts across finance, retail, hospitality, and energy sectors, I’ve realized that social media and
digital tools are double-edged swords. They’re essential for collaboration and staying updated, but they can hijack your
attention if left unchecked. I’m not one to delete all accounts or go off-grid—that’s impractical in today’s connected
world. Instead, I’ve adopted digital minimalism to control how these platforms influence me, ensuring I have the mental
bandwidth for deep work. Here are five strategies I’ve implemented to stay productive while remaining an active
participant in the digital world:

### 1. Unsubscribe from irrelevant emails

Between debugging microservices and managing CI/CD pipelines, the last thing I need is an inbox cluttered with
promotional emails or outdated newsletters. A full inbox isn’t just annoying—it’s a cognitive drain that distracts from
coding. To declutter, I review each subscription email as it arrives. If it’s not directly relevant to my current
projects (like API docs or team updates) or likely to be useful soon, I scroll to the bottom and hit “unsubscribe.”
Over time, this has slashed my inbox noise, leaving more mental space for tasks like optimizing a Spring Boot service.
For subscriptions I keep—like tech newsletters or project alerts. I use unroll.me to bundle them into a single daily
digest, which I tackle when I’m ready, not when my inbox dictates.

### 2. Unfollow people on social media

As a contractor, I’ve connected with countless colleagues, clients, and tech communities on platforms like LinkedIn and
Twitter. But following everyone—coworkers from past gigs, random tech influencers, or brands—bloats my feeds with
irrelevant posts, drowning out updates from my core network. I’ve made it a habit to unfollow or mute accounts that
don’t add value to my work or personal growth. This includes people I don’t collaborate with anymore, brands pushing
ads, or influencers whose posts feel more like noise than insight. For example, I keep my feeds focused on Java, AWS, or
Kubernetes discussions that inform my projects. The mute feature is a lifesaver for politely sidelining acquaintances
without unfollowing them outright, preserving professional ties while streamlining my digital experience.

### 3. Take occasional social media purges

Social media can be a reflex. I’ve caught myself reaching for my phone during a compile or while waiting for a Jenkins
build. These micro-distractions add up, especially when you’re deep in a project like integrating 50,000 product prices
for Co-op. To break the habit, I do periodic social media purges, where I avoid platforms for a set time, from a day to
a week. My go-to method is to delete the apps (Twitter, LinkedIn) from my phone and resist reinstalling until the purge
is over. The effort to redownload stops reflexive checks, and after a couple of days, I notice sharper focus and more
time for tasks like writing BPMN processes in Activiti. Another trick I’ve borrowed is setting my phone to Do Not
Disturb for a few hours daily, delaying notifications until I’m ready to engage. It’s surprising how little I miss, even
on urgent projects.

### 4. Turn off notifications for non-essential things

Notifications are the enemy of flow state. Every ping from a Slack channel, email, or social media alert pulls me out of
coding, and studies suggest it can take 23 minutes to fully refocus. When I was optimizing the BOL Engine at ESG Global,
I couldn’t afford those interruptions. I systematically disable notifications for anything non-critical. For example, I
keep alerts for GitLab CI/CD pipeline failures or direct messages from my team but turn off likes, mentions, or
marketing emails. Each day, I review new notifications and disable those that don’t justify the distraction. This
conscious pruning keeps my focus on tasks like resolving performance bottlenecks, which once unlocked 30% more capacity
for smart meter data.

### 5. Learn how to leverage built in tools

Modern phones and operating systems offer powerful tools to enforce digital discipline. My favorite is Do Not Disturb,
which I use when diving into complex code, like the Spring Boot microservice for Ribby Hall Village. On both iOS and
Android, I configure it to allow only critical notifications (e.g., calls from key contacts or urgent Slack messages),
silencing everything else during work hours. I also use Screen Time (iOS) or Digital Wellbeing (Android) to set limits
on distracting apps. For instance, I cap Twitter to 30 minutes daily, which forces me to be intentional with my usage.
These tools add a layer of accountability, helping me stay productive without feeling deprived.

### Why Digital Minimalism Matters

Digital minimalism isn’t about rejecting technology, it’s about using it deliberately. As a developer, I rely on digital
tools for coding, collaboration, and staying current in tech. But without boundaries, they can overwhelm, reducing the
clarity I need for tasks like architecting a Kubernetes deployment or debugging a REST API integration. By curating my
digital life, I’ve reclaimed time and focus, which directly translates to better code and happier clients. If you’re
feeling swamped by digital noise, try these five steps. They’ve helped me thrive in demanding projects across
industries, from retail to energy. For inspiration, I recommend Matt D’Avella’s documentary on minimalism, it’s a great
starting point for rethinking your relationship with tech.
