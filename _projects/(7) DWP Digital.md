# DWP Digital – New Style JSA Modernisation Programme

This engagement with DWP Digital focuses on the modernisation of one of the UK government’s core benefits platforms: New
Style Jobseeker’s Allowance (JSA).
The programme is part of a wider digital transformation initiative aimed at replacing legacy constraints with a
resilient, scalable, and policy-responsive architecture capable of supporting millions of citizens reliably and
securely.

The work centres on evolving the platform toward cloud-native, event-driven services, improving operational robustness,
simplifying policy change, and ensuring the system can meet current and future demand with confidence.

## Key Contributions

- **Legacy Modernisation**: Contributing to the redesign and refactoring of legacy components into modern Spring Boot
  services, reducing technical debt and improving long-term maintainability.
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Supporting the adoption of Kafka-based asynchronous processing to decouple core
  workflows, improve throughput, and increase system resilience under load.
- **Scalable Data Processing**: Working with MongoDB-backed services to handle high-volume benefit and entitlement data
  with predictable performance characteristics.
- **Cloud-First Delivery**: Developing services designed for AWS deployment, with an emphasis on horizontal scalability,
  fault tolerance, and operational transparency.
- **Resilience & Idempotency**: Designing and implementing patterns to ensure safe reprocessing, exactly-once business
  outcomes, and graceful recovery from partial failures.
- **Policy-Driven Design**: Supporting domain-led service boundaries that allow benefit rules and eligibility logic to
  evolve without destabilising the wider platform.
- **API-Led Integration**: Building and consuming RESTful APIs to integrate cleanly with upstream and downstream DWP
  services, enabling clearer ownership and separation of concerns.
- **Quality & Assurance**: Applying strong engineering discipline through automated testing, code review, and adherence
  to DWP Digital and GDS standards.
- **Multi-Team Collaboration**: Working closely with product managers, architects, testers, and policy stakeholders
  within a large-scale, multi-supplier delivery environment.
- **Production Readiness**: Ensuring services are observable, supportable, and compliant with operational requirements
  before release.

## Outtomes and Value:

- Improved system resilience for a nationally critical benefit.
- Greater flexibility to respond to policy and legislative change.
- Reduced operational risk through decoupled, fault-tolerant design.
- A platform foundation capable of future expansion and reform.
- This programme exemplifies large-scale, mission-critical digital delivery where engineering quality, operational
  resilience, and societal impact are equally important.
